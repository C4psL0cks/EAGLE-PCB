Light intensity sensor
TSL250 sensor is used. First part of circuit U1A, U1B function as logarithmic amplifier.
This is important if we want to have same sensitivity over entire measuring range.
Linearity of log amp is good enough, only 1-2% deviation. 
If someone wants better he might consider using LOG100 (Burr Brown). Function of U3 is : (U3A-U3B)*(Amp+1). 
When circuit is build output of circuit must be set to zero - 0 V at complete dark. You can do this by turning P1. 
Becouse of transistor negative temp. coeficient, circuit must be compensated.
Use RES R4 with positive temp coef. of 3400ppm/K.
