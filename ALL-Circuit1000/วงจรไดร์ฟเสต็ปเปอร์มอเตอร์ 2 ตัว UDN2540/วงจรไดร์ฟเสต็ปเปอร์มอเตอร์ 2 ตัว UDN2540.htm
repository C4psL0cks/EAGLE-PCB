The UDN2540B is a quad darlington power driver, manufactured by Allegro. Each output can sink up to 1.8A continuous. The typical applications include print heads, relays, solenoids, and stepping motors. It is a replacement for L6221A.
In this design we use two UDN2540B to drive two stepping motors at the same speed. Each motor can be independently controlled. The S1, S2 switches control the ON/OFF and the moving direction of Motor1. The S3, S4 control the Motor2, respectively.
