Several simple 
circuits were tried -- a lamp, battery and probes still demanded the attention 
of the eyes; replacing the lamp with a buzzer was more successful but needed 
some three to four volts and gave no indication of a series semiconductor 
junction if the polarity was correct while the current flow was large enough to 
damage the more delicate devices within the circuit under test. An extension of 
the principle to operate an astable (multivibrator) type of oscillator gave good 
audibility but would operate from zero through to several thousands of ohms and 
so was too general an indication.<BR><BR>A set of specifications was becoming 
apparent; (1) probe current to be small; (2) probe voltage to be as low as 
possible, preferable less than 0.3V to avoid seeing germanium or silicon 
junctions as a continuous circuit; (3) no on/off switch to be used.<BR>The above 
circuit was the result and several have been designed and are earning their keep 
for both "heavy" electricians and electronic technicians.<BR>
Descriptive 
Notes:</FONT></U><BR>The output from the speaker is not loud but is more than 
adequate for the purpose. I used a small transistor radio loudspeaker with an 
impedance of 25 - 80 Ohms. <FONT color=#ff0000>The resistance should be brought 
up to 300 ohms by adding series resistor R8.</FONT> Example, if your speaker is 
58 ohms, then R8 = 242 ohms.<BR><BR>An experiment worth doing is to select the 
value of either C1 or C2 to produce a frequency oscillation that coinsides with 
the mechanical resonant frequency of the particular loudspeaker in use. Having 
choosen the right value, which probably lies in the range of 10n - 100n, the 
tone will be louder and more earpiercing. A "freewheel" diode D2 is connected 
across the transducer since fast switching action of the oscillator circuit can 
produce a surprisingly high back e.m.f. across the coil and these high voltages 
might otherwise lead to transistor damage or breakdown.<BR><BR>Zener diodes do 
not provide an absolutely constant volt-drop regardless of current; at the 0.8 
mA design current an 8.2 volt diode will quite possibly give only about 8.0 volt 
drop since test current for zener selection and marking is typically 5 mA or 
more. A further possible source of error is the battery; the one suggested, 
nominally provides 9V but a brandnew one may be as much as 9.2 - 9.6V until 
slightly run-down and this "surplus" voltage, combined with an "under-voltage" 
zener volt-drop will leave considerably more than the forecast voltage available 
at the probes. A silicon diode D1 is therefore connected in series with the 
zener to decrease the probe voltage by a further 0.6 volt or so.<BR><BR>During 
your final testing and before boxing your circuit, the most suitable connection, 
A or B, is selected for the positive probe wire. The aim is to have the circuit 
oscillating with short circuited probes but to stop oscillation with the least 
amount of resistance or the inclusion of a diode (try both ways) between the 
probes.<BR><BR>No sensitivity control is fitted because I don't think it is 
worthwhile nor necessary and would spoil the simplicity of the 
circuit.<BR><BR>There is no easy way to proof the unit against connection to the 
supply. Be <I><B>careful</B></I> if checking AC line wiring and switch off 
first. In a similar way, if checking electronic apparatus for unwanted bridging 
between tracks, for instance or a suspected crack in a PCB (Printed Circuit 
Board) track switch off power first also.
