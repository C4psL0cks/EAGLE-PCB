The current and voltage channels are similar:  60Hz bandpass filter, limiter, and comparator.<br> 
The comparators feed an exclusive-or circuit which produces the output pulse.  To determine if the current is leading or lagging, the voltage and current channel outputs are ANDed with the power factor output.  There will only be output from the LAG gate when the current is lagging.  <br>
The only adjustment is R4 which tunes the bandpass filter, adjusting it's phase to compensate for com <br>
