Q1  MPSA14 Low Power NPN Transistor  
SIREN  Micro piezo siren 12V DC 150mA, 110dB @ 1M  
LOOP  See "Notes"  
 The loop can be any type of hookup wire, with a maximum resistance of about 90K. Using very thin wire (40AWG, for example) will make a very sensitive trip wire, but will shorten the distance it can be strung due to the high resistance. 

 The siren can be replaced with a relay to drive external loads.
