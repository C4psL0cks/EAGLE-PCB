</PRE><FONT color=red><B></B></FONT>This circuit shows a pair of 
CMOS NOR gates which form a push-button-activated one-shot multivibrator 
relay-switching circuit that provides delays up to several minutes with 
resonable accuracy. The relay turns on as soon as the START switch S1 is 
closed.<BR>However, it turns off again after a preset delay of about 0.5 seconds 
per microFarad (&micro;F) of the value of capacitor C2. The two CMOS gates are 
configured as a manually-triggered monostable multivibrator whose output is fed 
to the relay through R4 and transistor Q1.<BR><BR>
