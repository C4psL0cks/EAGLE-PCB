R1 250 Ohm 10 Watt Resistor   <br>
R2 500K Pot  <br>
R3 680K 1/4 Watt Resistor <br>
D1,D2 1N4004 Silicon Diode <br>
C1, C2 22 uF 350V Capacitor <br>
C3 0.47uF 400 Volt Mylar Capacitor 
T1 4KV Trigger Transformer (see "Notes") <br>
L1 Flash Tube (see "Notes") <br>
L2 Neon Bulb <br>
Q1 106 SCR <br>
F1 115V 1A Fuse <br>
Misc Case, Wire, Line Cord, Knob For R2 <br>

Notes<br>
1. T1 and L1 are available from The Electronics Goldmine <br>

2. This ciruits is NOT isolated from ground. Use caution when operating without a case. A case is required for normal operation. Do not touch any part of the circuit with the case open or not installed. <br>

3. Most any diodes rated at greater then 250 volts at 1 amp can be used instead of the 1N4004's. <br>

4. Do not operate this circuit at high flash rates for more than about 30 seconds or else C1 and C2 will overheat and explode. <br>

5. There is no on/off switch in the schematic, but you can of course add one. <br>
