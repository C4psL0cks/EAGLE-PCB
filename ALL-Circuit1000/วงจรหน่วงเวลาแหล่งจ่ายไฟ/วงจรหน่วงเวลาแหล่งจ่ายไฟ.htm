I had designed up an oscillator with a Power Output circuit. Problem was when power was applied <br>
to the entire circuit, the output of the Oscillator gave a Momentary Spike into the output circuit. <br>
Thus Driving it full on for a split second. <br>
This Circuit connected in the DC Supply to the Power amp, just gives a Tiny Delay. <br>
Not sure if it will be useful to others, But Thought I would post it anyway. <br>
