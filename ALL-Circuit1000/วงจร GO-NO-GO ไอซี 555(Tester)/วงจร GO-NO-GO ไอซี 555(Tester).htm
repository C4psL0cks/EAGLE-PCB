This is a more advanced unit with a precise timed testing procedure.<BR><BR>R1 (2M2) is 
same as 2.2 MegOhm.<BR>The two timers determine the allowable accuracy for the 
timer IC under test. Potentiometers P1 and P2 permit ready adjustment for the 
desired range.<BR>With power applied, all timers switch to the high state and 
begin their cycles. The output of IC1 inhibits the flip-flop for the interval 
T1. At T2, the output of IC2 goes low and inhibits any signal from the timer 
under test. The period between T1 and T2 is the time alloted for IC3, the timer 
under test, to complete its cycle and produce a low output. Only during this 
time can a high-to-low transition from IC3 trigger the Flip-Flop IC5 so that Led 
1 (timer ok), which indicates a good IC, lights up. Led 2 lights up when the 
test is completed.<BR><BR>Although there can be a few milliseconds of contact 
bounce when S1 is first closed, thereby causing a delay in capacitor charging, 
the delay appears across all of the IC's. But since the ratio of delay times 
among all three timers is the same, the effect on test accuracy is 
nil.<BR><BR>How you get to the 5 volt supply power is up to you. Supply power 
should be between 4.5V (min) and 5.5 (max). Probably three 1.5V alkalines will 
total about 4.8V because they are never exactly 1.5 V but always between 1.56 
and 1.59V or so, and will do the job until the voltage drops below 4.5V. A 
simple stabilized 5V power supply would be better choice, or use a 5 volt 
regulator with a 9 volt battery, works also. Do not forget to connect power to 
the 7400 and 74101 IC's (see circuit diagram). Standard procedure is that if 
they are not drawn, they are assumed. You can get the LS types (low schottky) 
which draw less current.<BR>At this time I'm bench testing the cmos 
types.<BR><BR>Note: While bench testing I found that older timers like the &micro;A555 
and the MC1455, although good, were difficult to test. I tried extending the 
testing period (in seconds) by adjusting trimpot P2 and got an ok from led2 for 
the MC1455 but no such luck with the &micro;A555. The LM555 and NE555 testing were 
excellent. I will test a couple more, including the cmos versions, and post my 
findings here. If I can find the time I will modify the power supply for use 
with a regular 9 volt battery instead of the bit ackward 5 volt 
supply...<BR>
