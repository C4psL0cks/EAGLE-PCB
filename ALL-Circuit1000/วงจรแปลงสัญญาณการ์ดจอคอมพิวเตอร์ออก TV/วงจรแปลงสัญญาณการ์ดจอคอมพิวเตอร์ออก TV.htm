Here are two schematic taken from Tomi ENGDAHL and the software under windows<br>
NOTE:<br>
I realized the first schematic shown here, cause it's more simply, but I took all informations about the other pins from the second schematic, click the buttons on top and you will understand what I mean.  
BE careful to all connections and control everything more than once to ensure the circuit to work . Note that the scart cable must have the 19 and 20 pin inverted if it's not so do it ! or your circuit will never work.
I have put all in my monitor case and got out with a scart outlet .
With this project you can play games, watch photos or video on your pc but FORGET TO USE WINDOWS, infact there is a flickering on the image that is really impossible to read texts without being annoyed .
besides it's impossible to eliminate it !.<BR> และใช้ร่วมกับโปรแกรม VGA TV <br>
