The time delay can be controlled by different values for C1 and R2. The delay is approximately 0.5 seconds for every &micro;F as 
value for C1. The delay can further be made variable by replacing R2 with a 
fixed and a variable resistor equal to that of the value of R2. Taken the value 
for R2 of 680K, it would be a combination of 180K for the fixed resistor in 
series with a 500K variable trim pot. The fixed resistor <U>is</U> 
necessary.<BR><BR>
