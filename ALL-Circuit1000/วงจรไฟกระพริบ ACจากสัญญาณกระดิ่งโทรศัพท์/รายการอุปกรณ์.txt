C1  0.47uF 250V Capacitor  
R1, R2   10K 1/4 W Resistor  
R3   1K 1/4W Resistor  
D1, D2   20V 1/4W Zener Diode  
D3   1N4148 Diode  
Q1   2N3904 NPN Transistor 2N2222 
U1   4N27 Opto Isolator  
RELAY   Solid State Or Regular Relay (See Notes)  
MISC   Case, Wire, Board  


Notes:
1. You may need to use a lower voltage zener for D1 and D2. 

2. You can use a regular relay instead of a solid state relay, but the arcing accross the contacts may destroy it pretty quickly. 

3. Be very sure that you have not accidentally connected 120V to the phone line when building and installing this circuit.
