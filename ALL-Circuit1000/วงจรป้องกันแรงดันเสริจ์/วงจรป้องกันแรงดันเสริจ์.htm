This circuit was developed to overcome the instant surge current  when a 25 or 50 watt RV lamps is turned on.  When power is applied the thermistor limits the current allowing the lamp to heat.  After about 10 seconds the relay is engergized and shorts out the thermistor allowing full voltage to the lamp.
