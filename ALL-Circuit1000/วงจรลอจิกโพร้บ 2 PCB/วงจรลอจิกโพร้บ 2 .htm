Tester was designed to fast test primary (zinc, alcaline) cell. Contains simple voltage converter and level indicator. Tester is powered from tested cell. Supply current is depend of cell voltage and at 1.5 V is approx. 200 mA. For high efficiency voltage converting must be low saturation voltage transistor T1 used. Tester has polarity tolerant input (max. 3 V).
