This low-cost function generator, based on the Maxim MAX038 high-frequency waveform generator, produces sine, triangle, and square waves from under 1 Hz to over 20 MHz  (See figure Below). The frequency, amplitude, and offset of all output waveforms are adjustable, as is the duty cycle of the square wave. <BR>
The output at U1-19 is 2 V p-p, centered around zero, for all waveforms. For amplitude adjustment, R18 and R9 form a voltage divider. The portion of U1-19 fed to the summing amplifier U3 varies from 0.74% to 100%. The summing amplifier multiplies this voltage by -12.2, so the signal at U3-6 will vary from 0.18 V p-p to 24.4 V p-p <BR>
