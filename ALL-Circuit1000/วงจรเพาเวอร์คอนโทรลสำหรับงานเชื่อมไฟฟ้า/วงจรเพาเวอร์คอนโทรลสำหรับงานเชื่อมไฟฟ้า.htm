This is a 240V(single) phase power controller circuit for arc welders or other inductive loads. The main component is an 'alternistor', this is a sort of triac, and the actual type can be chosen for the design load. The TPDV640 alternistor is quite adequate for welders that plug into normal 10Amp 240V supply. This circuit has been well tested on a common heavy duty home arc welder made by Cigweld. The circuit controls power from full, right down to nothing, and has enabled me to weld on finer materials, and reduce blowing holes through the metal. <br>
