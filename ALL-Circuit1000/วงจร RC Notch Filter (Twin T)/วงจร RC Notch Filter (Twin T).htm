<p><img  src="001.gif"> <br>

The twin T notch filter can be used block an unwanted frequency or if placed around an op-amp as a bandpass filter. The notch frequency occurs where the capacitive reactance equals the resistance (Xc=R) and if the values are close, the attenuation can be very high and the notch frequency virtually eliminated. The insertion loss of the filter will depend on the load that is connected to the output, so the resistors should be of much lower value than the load for minimal loss. At audio frequencies, the filter could function as a bass and treble boost circuit by attenuating the mid range frequencies. Using 1.5K resistors and 0.1uF capacitors, the band stop at -10dB is about 500 Hz to 2Khz. The depth and width of the response can be adjusted somewhat with the 0.5R value and by adding some resistance across the C values. If the circuit is used around an op-amp as a bandpass filter, the response may need to be dampened to avoid oscillation.
