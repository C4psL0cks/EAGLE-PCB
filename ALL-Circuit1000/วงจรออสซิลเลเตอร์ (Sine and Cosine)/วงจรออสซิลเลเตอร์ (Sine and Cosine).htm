In case of C=C1=C2, R=R4=R5, the oscillation frequency can be calculated by the following formula.
 

The example of the circuit which was made this time is shown below. <br>
f = 1/(2 x 3.14 x 0.001 x 10-6 x 15 x 103)  <br>

 = 1/(0.0942 x 10-3)  <br>

 = 10.62 x 103  <br>

 = 10.62 KHz  <br>

The frequency in the actual circuit was to 10.585 KHz be. <br>
