R1  100 Ohm 1/4W Resistor  
R2  470 Ohm 1/4W Resistor  
R3  10k 1/4W Resistor  
R4  100K 1/4W Resistor  
R5  1K 1/4W Resistor  
C1  47uF Electrolytic Capacitor  
U1  78L05 Voltage Regulator  
U2  LM339 Op Amp  
L1  #47 Incandescent lamp with glass removed (See "Notes")  
D1  LED  
 
Notes:
1. The glass will have to be removed from L1 without breaking the filament. Wrap the glass in masking tape and it in a vise. Slowly crank down until the glass breaks, then remove the bulb and carefully peel back the tape. If the filament has broken, you will need another lamp.
