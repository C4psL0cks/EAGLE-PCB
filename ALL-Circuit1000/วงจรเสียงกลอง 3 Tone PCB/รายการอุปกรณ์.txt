This is very simple circuit. Its intended to be used as a door bell.
 Just connetct switch to pin 2 and 4, and speaker to pin 1 and 2. Supply voltage is not critical, 5 V to 12 V should do the job. 
With trimmers you can adjust the speed of melody, and volume of sound. All you have to do now is to conect 4 ohm speaker 1 W - 2 W.
