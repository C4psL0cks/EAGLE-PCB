The simpler system is that of two streets. In that acoustic region it is separated in two sub areas with two filters: one of low passage and one high. The filter of low passage leads the loudspeaker for the low frequencies and the filter of high frequencies the loudspeaker for the high frequencies. The loudspeaker for the low frequencies is known as woofer and the loudspeaker for the high frequencies as tweeter. 
<br>
 The loudspeakers are distinguished by various characteristics that him make distinguish between them. That characteristics that us interest for the manufacture that we make, are their complex or more simply resistance and diagram that us gives the relation of attribution of sound as for frequency (sensitivity). 
<br>
 The resistance of loudspeakers is characterized in a frequency depending on the destination and their press.  Loudspeakers are distinguished, as for the destination, in loudspeakers of low frequencies, woofer intermediate, mid-range and high tweeter. Their resistance in W is 4W, 8W and 16W. Cross-over that we present it is intended for loudspeakers 8W

Manufacture  <br>
In order to you make the manufacture you will need the PCB that appears in form. In this mount materially that exists in the theoretical circuit, according to form.  The montage of materials will begin from the resistances and flowingly will place the capacitors and finally the self-induction. The inductors for the cross-over, if him you find in trade you cans him order from us. In order to you try the cross - over   apply in the exit for the each loudspeaker a resistance 8W. In the entry you will connect a small amplifier with which you will strengthen the signal of acoustic generator. The generator him you will put it produces sine' signal. Altering the frequency we observe the each expense in an oscillograph. If all have well, then when is increased the frequency and approaches the price 3,5kHz, the tendency in the exit for the loudspeaker of low frequencies falls and the other increases.
