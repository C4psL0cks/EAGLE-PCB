Power Converter<bR>
The power converter is one of many subsystems created for the NSRV project.  It is a general design that can be used in other projects.  The power converter is an all surface mount circuit that boosts or steps up +1.2 VDC to +14VDC up to +14VDC at 1 AMP in a 1" x 1.25" package.  The switching regulator operates near 90% efficiency and doesn't require a heat sink even at full output current at +85?C.  The circuit shown is configured for +9.0 VDC output.
