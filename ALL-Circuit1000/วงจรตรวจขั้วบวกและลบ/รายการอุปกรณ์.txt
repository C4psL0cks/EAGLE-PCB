R1  1K 1/4W Resistor  
D1  Green LED  
D2   Red LED  
D4, D5, D6, D7       1N4001
MISC     Board, Wire, Case, Probes 

To use the circuit, just connect your probes to the source under test. If D1 lights up, the left most probe (on the schematic) is connected to positive. The opposite is true if the left probe is negative. If both LEDs are on, the source being probed is AC.
