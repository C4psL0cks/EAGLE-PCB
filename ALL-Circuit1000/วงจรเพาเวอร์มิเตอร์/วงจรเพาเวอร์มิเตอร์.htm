This Power meter is capable of dissipating up to 100 watts for a short period and 20 watts continuously. <br>
You will need 20 1K ohm resistors connected in parallel, the resistors should be 1 watt. <br>
To set up calibration: <br>
Adjust the 47k for the low power range against a calibrated power meter, then adjust the 470K for the high power range against a calibtated power meter, do not re-adjust the 47k on high power.<br>
