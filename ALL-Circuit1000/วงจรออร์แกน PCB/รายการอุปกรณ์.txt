Notes
1. You can tune the organ to any instrument by adjusting R1-R8. I used a clarinet to tune mine, but you can of course use any instrument you wish. 

2. The circuit may drain a 9V battery fairly quickly at full volume. You may remove R11 for even more sound. 

3. You can rig up a relay and a foot switch to change C1 (for a different octive) while your playing.
