Many of these transmissions are broadcast at frequencies between the broadcast band (that is, from 87 to 107 MHz) and 30 MHz. This simple receiver (located in the USA) received signals from Asia, Europe, South America and North America. The antenna was a 14 foot indoor wire<br>

The form onto which the wire will be wrapped is a typical plastic film can. Wrap the can with 1-1/2" 2-sided tape. Then wrap the form with 30 gauge magnet wire at a width of 1-1/2", leaving both ends extend a couple of inches (later to be soldered directly to circuitry). Then take a piece of uninsulated 12 gauge solid copper wire and secure one end to the wooden platform and then bend it slightly to cover the whole width of the plastic film can. Where-ever the 12 gauge wire touches the width of the can, lightly sand off the enamel-coating on the 30 gauge magnet wire. This will ensure a continuity between the 12 gauge wire (called the slider) and the 30 gauge wire.<br>
