The step down converter is the power unit to make the output voltage which is lower than the input voltage. The converter which was made this time makes +2V to +10V output voltage with the input voltage of +12V. Because it makes the limitation value of the input electric current about 1.3A, the maximum with the input electric power is about 16W.
