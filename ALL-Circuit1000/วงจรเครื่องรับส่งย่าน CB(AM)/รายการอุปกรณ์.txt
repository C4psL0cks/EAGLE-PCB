 VK200 (inductor of high frequencies).
 
L1, L2
 Wires of coper (smaltwme'na) with diameter 0,4mm wrapped in plastic support of diameter 6-7mm of perjstrofjkoy' core. For the L1 you wrap 13 coils. For the L2   you wrap 4 coils. (As in the receptor CB.)
 
L3
 Wrap 20 coils cupreous wire of (0,3-0,4mm diameter) convolution round a resistance 2,2W/2W of coal.

Y1, Y2?
 Crystal hails. (You can you put the so much, those who also channels that you want you emit). See here.
 
MIC
 microphone with preamplifier.
 
ANT1
 Aerial for CB (For the trials is enough a piece wire of few metres but better connects a regular aerial so that does not have many stagnantly and burns the transmitter).
 
S1
 (Choice of receptor of - transmitter, if you combine the transmitter with the receptor CB, you are supplied the receptor from exit 12V OUT)
 
S2
 Switch of choice of channel. It has so much places, those who also the channels that you want pja'nete.(Kaly'tera he is mechanically connected with the S1 of receptor for simultaneous change of channels).
