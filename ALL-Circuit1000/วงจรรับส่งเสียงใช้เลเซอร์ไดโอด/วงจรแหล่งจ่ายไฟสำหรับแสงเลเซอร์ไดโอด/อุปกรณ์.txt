R1  10 Ohm 10W Or Greater Resistor  
R2  Ballast Resistor, See "Notes"  
D1, D2, D3   1N4007 Silicon Diode  
C1, C2, C3   0.1 uF 2000V Capacitor  
T1   9V 1A Transformer  
S1   115V 2A SPST Switch  
MISC    Case, Wire, Binding Posts (for output), Line Cord  


Notes
1. T1 is an ordinary 9V 1A transformer connected backwards for step up. 

2. R1 MUST be installed on a LARGE heatsink. A good heatsink is the metal case the supply is built in. 

3. R2 Protects the laser tube from excess current. It should be soldered directly to the anode terminal on the tube. To find R2, start with a 500K 10W resistor and work down until the tube lights and remains stable. 

4. If you have trouble with the tube not starting easily, use a longer anode lead that is wrapped around the tube. 

5. Depending on the transformer you use, the circuit may or may not work. I cannot guarantee the operation of this circuit. Build at your own risk.
