Notes:
1. In the transmitter schematic, no ballast resistor is shown because most small LASER power supplies already have one built in. Yours may differ, and a resistor may be needed. 

2. The receiver should be kept away from bright lights. You may want to put a piece of wax paper in front of Q1 to keep the LASER from swamping it. 

3. In order to get any decent amount of modulation, you may need to drive T1 with more then a watt. 

4. The circuit can be made to transmit computer data with the use of two modem chips.
