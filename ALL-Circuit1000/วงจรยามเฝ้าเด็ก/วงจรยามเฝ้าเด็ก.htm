It's a very simple circuit, for the follow-up of baby
. It can however be also used for other use
, as intercom etc. In the place of M1 we can we use a simple electret mic capsule.
 The regulation of gain becomes from the R1,
 whoever can be trimmer or potesometer.
 Has been added also a small automatism
, round the RL1 and battery 9V for the case where we have interruption of AC Line
. The life of battery is enough big, one and the consumption of current is small, 
roughly 30 mA, for loudspeaker 8R /0,4W.
 The transistors do not need heatsink, one and work in Class B.
